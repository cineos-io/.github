# CineOs

**Search cinema the way your memory works.**

<br/>

You don't remember movies by title, genre, or cast.  
You remember a *feeling*. A *moment*. An *idea* you couldn't shake.

Every discovery tool today forces you to search the wrong way.  
**CineOs lets you search the way you actually think about film.**

### 🎯 The Problem

You're on the couch. You want to watch something — but not just *anything*.

You want that specific feeling. Something like the quiet tension of a family dinner where no one says what they mean. Or the bittersweet ache of watching someone let go of who they used to be.

You open Netflix. IMDb. Letterboxd. They ask:

> *"What genre? What actor? What year?"*

That's not how your brain works.

### 💡 How CineOs Works

Every film in CineOs is understood through three layers — the same way you remember it:

**Idea** — *What is this film really about?*  
Not the plot summary. The deeper thing. Power and isolation. Forgiveness that costs something. The lie families agree to believe.

**Feeling** — *How did it make me feel?*  
Not "happy" or "sad." More like: unsettled calm. Earned hope. The ache of something beautiful and broken.

**Moment** — *That one scene I can't forget.*  
The long silence before someone walks away. Rain on a window while the world changes. A door closing that means everything.

---

### 🔍 Search by Meaning, Not Metadata

Instead of typing keywords, you **adjust sliders** across conceptual and emotional dimensions.

> *"I want something about identity — but quiet, not dramatic. Something that sits with you."*

CineOs doesn't just return results. It **explains why** each film matches — which dimensions aligned, and where each film diverges to offer something unexpected.

### 🧬 The Movie Intelligence Graph

Every film is a single unified object called a **MIG** — a multi-dimensional map of what a film *is*, how it *feels*, and what *stays with you*.

| Layer | What It Captures |
|:--|:--|
| 💡 **Idea** | 12 conceptual dimensions — scored 0.0 to 1.0 |
| 💫 **Feeling** | 8 emotional axes — beyond simple sentiment |
| 🎞️ **Moment** | Visual, structural, and emotional motifs — connected as a graph |

This isn't a recommendation engine that says *"people who liked X also liked Y."*  
This is a **cinematic intelligence system** that understands *why* a film resonates.

---

### 🚀 What's Being Built

CineOs launches with **300 deeply mapped films** — each scored across all three layers, with 30+ films receiving full human annotation.

The MVP lets you:
- **Describe a space** using sliders — conceptually and emotionally
- **Get ranked results** with explanations for every match
- **Explore any film's full intelligence profile** — its DNA, emotional signature, and key motifs

### 📐 Principles
    Docs before code.
    Every design decision is documented.
    If it's not written down, it doesn't exist.

*IMDb tells you what a movie is.*  
*Letterboxd tells you what others thought.*  
***CineOs tells you why it stays with you.***
