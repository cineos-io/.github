You don't remember films by title, genre, or cast.<br/>
You remember a **feeling**. A **moment**. An **idea** you couldn't shake.

<h3>◈&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE PROBLEM WITH DISCOVERY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;◈</h3>
</div>

You're on the couch. You want to watch something — but not just *anything*.

You want that specific feeling. Something like the quiet tension of a family dinner where no one says what they mean. Or the bittersweet ache of watching someone let go of who they used to be.

You open Netflix. IMDb. Letterboxd. They all ask the same question:

> *"What genre? What actor? What year?"*

**That's not how your brain works.**

Every discovery tool today forces you to search the wrong way. CineOs lets you search the way you actually think about film.

<br/>

<div align="center">
<h3>◈&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE THREE LAYERS OF MEMORY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;◈</h3>
</div>

<br/>

Every film in CineOs is understood through three layers — the same way you remember it:

<table>
<tr>
<td width="33%" align="center">

**💡 IDEA**

*What is this film really about?*

Not the plot summary. The deeper thing. Power and isolation. Forgiveness that costs something. The lie families agree to believe.

`12 conceptual dimensions`<br/>`scored 0.0 → 1.0`

</td>
<td width="33%" align="center">

**💫 FEELING**

*How did it make me feel?*

Not "happy" or "sad." More like: unsettled calm. Earned hope. The ache of something beautiful and broken.

`8 emotional axes`<br/>`beyond simple sentiment`

</td>
<td width="33%" align="center">

**🎞️ MOMENT**

*That scene I can't forget.*

The long silence before someone walks away. Rain on a window while the world changes. A door closing that means everything.

`visual & structural motifs`<br/>`connected as a graph`

</td>
</tr>
</table>

<br/>

<div align="center">

> *This isn't a recommendation engine that says "people who liked X also liked Y."*
> *This is a **cinematic intelligence system** that understands **why** a film resonates.*

</div>

<br/>

<div align="center">
<h3>◈&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HOW IT WORKS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;◈</h3>
</div>

<br/>

Instead of typing keywords, you **adjust sliders** across conceptual and emotional dimensions.

> *"I want something about identity — but quiet, not dramatic. Something that sits with you."*

CineOs doesn't just return results. It **explains why** each film matches — which dimensions aligned, and where each film diverges to offer something unexpected.

**The Movie Intelligence Graph (MIG)** — Every film is a single unified object: a multi-dimensional map of what a film *is*, how it *feels*, and what *stays with you*.

*IMDb tells you what a movie is.*
*Letterboxd tells you what others thought.*
***CineOs tells you why it stays with you.***
